# Micromanage
Remotely install and manage clients

tldr; munki, but flipped.

## Features:
 - Backend tells clients to install software - not hoping the client can do that sucessfully.
 - Logical and reliable software management on endpoints
 - Simple script deployment
 - Inventory of devices and automatically label printing maybe


## Things to do:
 - frontend, probably react or vue - mm-web
 - local appstore-like interface - mm-ui
 - finish the client so it fully reports information - mac-client
 - fix some of the awful hacks in the backend - mm-backend
